        <h2><strong>Art Photos</strong></h2>
        <p>Below are five pictures of Art taken at various places and moments throughout my life. Most of the photos 
            were taken while I was in an intro to Arts class however, some are a product of my own volition. While they are not ordered chronologically, they are ordered based on subjective and inexplicable whims. All photos are mine and all requests to use them but be directed to ovillanueva@guilford.edu.</p>
