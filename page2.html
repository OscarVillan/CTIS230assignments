    <h2><strong>Art Photos</strong></h2>
    <p>Below are five pictures of Art taken at various places and moments throughout my life. Most of the photos
        were taken while I was in an intro to Arts class however, some are a product of my own volition. While they are
        not ordered chronologically, they are ordered based on subjective and inexplicable whims.</p>
        <p><span class="arr">All photos are mine
        and all requests to use them must be directed to ovillanueva@guilford.edu.</span></p>
