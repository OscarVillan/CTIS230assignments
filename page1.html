    <h2><strong>Photos Of Wildlife</strong></h2>
    <p>Below are five pictures of wildlife taken at various places and moments throughout my life. While they are not
        ordered chronologically, they are ordered based on subjective and inexplicable. </p>
    <p><span class="arr">All photos are mine and
            all requests to use them must be directed to ovillanueva@guilford.edu.</span></p>
