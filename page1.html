    <h2><strong>Photos Of Wildlife</strong></h2>
    <p>Below are five pictures of wildlife taken at various places and moments throughout my life. While they are not
        ordered chronologically, they are ordered based on subjective and inexplicable whims. All photos are mine and
        all requests to use them but be directed to ovillanueva@guilford.edu.</p>
