                My Background
            </div>
            <p ID="background" class="p"> Lao/Caucasian ethnicity, born in Berkeley, California.
                I can understand Spanish and read and write at a novice level, I am working on regaining fluency at
                school while
                I study for my degree.
                My hobbies include disk golf, gaming, traveling, and bowling.
                I have worked in a diverse amount of work environments doing a wide variety of jobs and tasks.
                I believe I have strengths in my work ethic and productivity, I struggle with punctuality however, I can
                conform
                to strict policy.
                <p class="p">My weaknesses is my humanity and discomfort when making morally ambiguous choices relating to company
                profit vs
                consumer wellbing.
                I also strongly dislike upselling and could never be put in charge of taking poor peoples money.
                I believe my lack of enthusiasm to commit highway robbery against the poor could be remedied by instead
                robbing
                the rich. My dream job is a job that requires no moral greyness and actually helps people. If I can't achieve that I will embrace the moral sacrifices and become a philanthropist later.</p>
