    <h4> My Background</h4>
    <p> Lao/Caucasian ethnicity, born in Berkeley, California.
        I can understand Spanish and read and write at a novice level, I am working on regaining fluency at school while
        I study for my degree.
        My hobbies include disk golf, gaming, traveling, and bowling.
        I have worked in a diverse amount of work environments doing a wide variety of jobs and tasks.
        I believe I have strengths in my work ethic and productivity, I struggle with punctuality however, I can conform
        to strict policy.
        My weaknesses is my humanity and discomfort when making morally ambiguous choices relating to company profit vs
        consumer wellbing.
        I also strongly dislike upselling and could never be put in charge of taking poor peoples money.
        I believe my lack of enthusiasm to commit highway robbery against the poor could be remedied by instead robbing
        the rich.
